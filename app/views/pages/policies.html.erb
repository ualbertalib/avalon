  <h2 id="digital-preservation">Digital Preservation Statement</h2>
  <p>UAL employs a number of strategies to ensure the preservation of digital material within ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V. Preservation is about more than just keeping a backup copy. It requires a commitment to monitoring and actively maintaining the content so that future generations will be able to find, discover and use today’s digital material regardless of changes to formats and technologies. Our strategies are informed by relevant standards and community best practices. For more information please visit <a href="/technology">Technology and Partnerships</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="take-down-policy">Take-Down Policy</h2>
  <p>
  The removal of an item from ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V once it is deposited is generally discouraged. However, items will be temporarily taken down under the following scenarios until a determination is made to either restore or permanently remove the item:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A copyright dispute emerges requiring investigation.</li> 
    <li>There is disagreement among multiple copyright holders over whether the item should be placed in ERA.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Items will be removed immediately if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We become aware of any illegal activity facilitated by an item in ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V</li>
    <li>An ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V item is used for internet nuisance activity by a user, such as to spam others</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="metadata-quality">Metadata Quality Policy</h2>
  <p>Detailed policy and practice workflows exist to ensure that ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V metadata is of the highest possible quality. Metadata already within ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V may undergo enhancement on an ad-hoc or project basis. This allows for optimum collation, dissemination, and preservation of ERA A<span class="plus">&plus;</span>V content. Contact <a href="mailto:erahelp@ualberta.ca">erahelp@ualberta.ca</a> for more information.</p>
